# Using Gaussian Processes to Address the Issues of Predicting Financial Time Series

In this report, the statistical modelling technique *Gaussian process regression* is exploited to generate predictions over a financial time series (logarithmic returns of the cryptocurrency pair ETH/USD). The method is shown to overcome challenges of complex systems, such as non-linear dependencies between variables and non-stationarity, producing a model that captures the highly volatile trend of this financial time series and generalises well to future observation times.
